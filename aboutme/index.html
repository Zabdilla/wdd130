    <p>Hi dear classmates,</p>
    <p>I am Zabdi. I was born in Mexico City and raised in Baja California, Mx. I moved to United States 5 years ago and
        it has been a big adventure. I love to hike the beautiful Mountains in Utah, and explore small towns. I love to
        try ice cream places and burger's restaurants, I can say is one of my hobbies.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing an Associates Degree in Applied Technology. This is totally new for me. Previously I worked 6 years
        as a stained glass artist and then started studying Family History Research. After seeing some of my husband's
        assigments, I got interested in coding. This is my 1st semester taking classes on this new path.</p>
    <p>I hope to learn the basics of coding in this class and prepare step by step to become a Web Developer.</p>
