      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Tacos Renteria is intended to recreate the spectacular flavor of northern Mexican tacos and other staple dishes. The idea came when the Renteria family arrived in Rexburg, Idaho. They noticed the lack of authentic Mexican food and decided to bring the best ingredients and selection there. They knew the Rexburg people were mostly students, so they decided to focus on offering great and nutritious food at affordable prices.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Tacos Renteria is for everyone who needs a good meal in a short time and for anyone who is tired of fast-food.  Our menu is tailored to the whole family. For littles kids we have an extended menu of different tacos with no chile and a small tortilla. For teenagers and adults, we supply them with enormous portions of tacos, tortas and huaraches. For the elderly population we bring a variety of authentic Mexican soups.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content

      <h3>Nutritional value (Home) </h3>
      <p>
        Page is going to display a colorful background (green) and 2 images showing veggies and someone making the food. These visual helps are intended to refer to the following topics.
The main purpose of this page is to illustrate how important is nutrition for us (as a business and family), and the different caloric contribution of each of our items on sale to the public. This will make sure every client knows what they are eating and how important they are to us. This is an important part of the plan; it is designed to educate people about common fast food and how to transform it to something healthy. It will include a simple guide on how to mix and match our items available to achieve a nutritious meal. 
-Our site will also provide a background and short history about how the business was created and where the recipes come from. This will help people imagine a little bit more about the type of cuisine we prepare. We are going to explain how Ensenada was influenced by Hindus, and some of their tricks on how to use spices and their practical ideas on cooking. 
Mexican food restaurants are characterized by good food and good customer service. Our page will have these 2 characteristics and will be distinguished by showing just quality ingredients.
As an extra, we are going to provide information about our main providers, this will make sure our clients can have in mind how we are working with locals to provide fresh food.

      </ul>
      <h3> Menu </h3>
      <p>
        Menu is going to have a red background and pictures for each of our items for sale. This page will focus on large images with a simple font to not create much distraction. Each of our meal will have the ingredients listed and will include details like: gluten-free, spicy, lactose-free, and raw. Our page is going to present prices and a complete menu of our items available at the time. It will also show when we run out of certain ingredients or meals. Menu will also provide a suggestion or combos leading to “healthy” or “complete” combos to make the page more user friendly (as how someone would be recommending tacos to them).
Our images will also help our clients crave Mexican food. The plan is to find the most appealing images of each of the plates to help people create in their minds the exact idea on what they will order. We will include sizes of each of the items and portions. We will include silly phrases to compare our plates with.
On our menu the emphasis is in preparing the client to order and to trust each of our plates.

      </ul>
      <h3>Ordering site</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to Taco’s Renteria page to order food from our business. That is the profitable side of our site. The ordering site page will provide a simple place an order of tacos (or other things from our menu) and have delivery service as an option. This will favor many of our busy clients. On this page will try to make really easy for everyone to order online. One of our goals is to provide a special treatment to our clients, so we are going to include details like: Exact time of waiting (they will know when we are preparing their order and when it is ready), how hot they want their food, a comments section, and a suggested tip by percentage (10%, 15%, 20%). The total will be available before ending the order to make sure they have everything correct.
After placing an order, we would give them a call if anything happens or changes (we run out of something) and we will try to make up to them.
